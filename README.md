# Tech Test Code Examples


The code within this repository has deliberately been written in a way to encourage discussion and to test a candidate's knowledge of Javascript and the surrounding ecosystem. 

No code is expected to run and the aim is not to make it - the aim is to recognise the flaws, to provide solutions and suggest improvements.

## The Task

For the given code, please list any and all problems you can see with the code and how you would fix and improve it.

## Backend Code Example

A dummy express server with a single route. The route should read Movie data from a static file and for each Movie, fetch information from a pretend third party service to fetch extra information. Once all the data has been collected, it should return a JSON response containing the resulting information.

## Frontend Code Example

A sample script that fetches data from several different services and then places the returned data onto the page. Don't worry about what data is being added to the page (assume that the data attributes are present in a potential response).
